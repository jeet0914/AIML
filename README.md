"This repository contains a variety of projects that I have developed while learning and experimenting with machine learning (ML), 
deep learning (DL), and generative AI techniques. The projects range from classic ML algorithms to advanced DL models and innovative 
generative AI applications. Each project is accompanied by code, documentation, and, where applicable, datasets."
